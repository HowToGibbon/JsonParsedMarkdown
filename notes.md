# The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers
## 14. Mentoring, Apprenticeship, and Craftsmanship
Amount of Notes: 18
- Quote: Those things are acquired through years of personal tutelage and mentoring. It is time for those of us in the software industry to face the fact that guiding the next batch of software developers to maturity will fall to us, not to the universities.
- Comment: Wenn das ja so bekannt ist, wieso ändert man die schule nicht? 
- Quote: School can teach the theory of computer programming. But school does not, and cannot teach the discipline, practice, and skill of being a craftsman.
- Quote: So now we are in a position to define this word: craftsmanship.
- Comment: Am ende des Buches top
- Quote: Programmers get raises and eventual promotions because, well, that’s just what you do with programmers.
- Quote: The problem is that, in most cases, this supervision is not technical!
- Quote: Graduates start their careers as apprentices
- Quote: Journeymen are the teachers
- Quote: Journeymen
- Quote: master
- Comment: Quick öist
- Quote:  It’s everywhere.

Given that we entrust software developers with all aspects of our lives, from the minutia to the momentous, I suggest that a reasonable period of training and supervised practice is not inappropriate
- Quote: we do not send graduates into a room, throw meat in occasionally, and expect good things to come out. So why do we do this in software?
- Quote: That education involves roughly equal amounts of classroom study and clinical activity in hospitals working with professionals.
- Quote: There just weren’t that many senior programmers in the early seventies. Everywhere else I worked, I was senior. There was nobody to help me figure out what true professional programming was. There was no role model who taught me how to behave or what to value. Those things I had to learn for myself, and it was by no means easy
- Quote: This was mentoring. Certainly it was not the kind of mentoring I could have hoped for. It would have been nice if one of those teachers had taken me under his wing and worked with me. But it didn’t matter, because I was observing them and learning at a furious pace.
- Quote: . I had learned long ago that it is better to ask forgiveness than permission!
- Quote: Do you remember the moment your first program worked? Did it change your life or set you on a course you could not turn away from?
- Quote: And it worked!
- Comment: That never happens on the first try
- Quote: The manual told you exactly where to put each tube, but not what the tubes did. I found this very frustrating!

## 12. Collaboration
Amount of Notes: 8
- Quote: Programming is all about working with people.
- Quote: Perhaps you believe that you work better when you work alone. That may be true, but it doesn’t mean that the team works better when you work alone
- Quote: professionals pair
- Quote:  I want the team to own the code, not the individuals
- Quote: One of the worst symptoms of a dysfunctional team is when each programmer builds a wall around his code and refuses to let other programmers touch it.
- Quote: responsibility of the professional programmer is to meet the needs of his or her employer
- Quote: Bugs aren’t interesting. Bugs just need to be fixed
- Quote: the group average still tends in the direction I stated. We, programmers, enjoy the mild sensory deprivation and cocoonlike immersion of focus
- Comment: Heute weniger

## 11. Pressure
Amount of Notes: 12
- Quote: when you see someone else who’s under pressure, offer to pair with them. Help them out of the hole they are in.
- Quote: Pair! When the heat is on, find an associate who is willing to pair program with you
- Quote: Rely on Your Disciplines
When the going gets tough, trust your disciplines. The reason you have disciplines is to give you guidance through times of high pressure.
- Quote: Avoid creating surprises
- Quote: Plot a course to the best possible outcome, and then drive towards that outcome at a reasonable and steady pace
- Quote: Manage your stress. Sleepless nights won’t help you get done any faster. Sitting and fretting won’t help either
- Quote: if you change your behavior in a crisis, then you don’t truly believe in your normal behavior.
- Quote: This does not mean that we spend endless hours polishing code. 
- Quote: we don’t tolerate messes. We know that messes will slow us down, causing us to miss dates and break commitments. So we do the best work we can and keep our output as clean as we can.
- Quote: In the end, if we can find no way to meet the promises made by the business, then the people who made the promises must accept the responsibility.
- Quote: . I laughed at the man in the mirror, the poor schmuck who’d been making life miserable for himself and others in the name of—what?
- Quote: In 1988 I was working at Clear Communications. This was a start-up that never quite got started

## 10. Estimation
Amount of Notes: 17
- Quote: Estimates are fraught with error. That’s why they are called estimates.
- Quote: We don’t want people changing their estimates based on what they see other people do.
- Quote: estimation technique called “wideband delphi.
- Quote: They can help you estimate your tasks more accurately than you can estimate them on your own
- Quote: Software professionals are very careful to set reasonable expectations despite the pressure to try to go fast.
- Quote: standard deviation4
- Comment: Straight out of exev
- Quote: When you estimate a task, you provide three numbers
- Quote: PERT is the way that estimates are calculate
- Quote: try is a loaded term
- Quote: An estimate is not a number. An estimate is a distribution.
- Quote: Probability distribution
- Quote: An estimate is a guess. No commitment is implied
- Quote: Missing a commitment is an act of dishonesty only slightly less onerous than an overt lie.
- Quote: Professionals don’t make commitments unless they know they can achieve them
- Quote: Business likes to view estimates as commitments. Developers like to view estimates as guesses. The difference is profound.
- Quote: It took three months
- Quote: If you’ve read my books, or heard my talks, you know I rant a lot about independent deployability. This is where I first learned that lesson.

## 6. Practicing
Amount of Notes: 4
- Quote: Professional programmers often suffer from a lack of diversity in the kinds of problems that they solve. Employers often enforce a single language, platform, and domain in which their programmers must work.
- Quote: Practicing a suite of katas is a good way to learn hot keys and navigation idioms. It is also a good way to learn disciplines such as TDD and CI. But most importantly, it is a good way to drive common problem/solution pairs into your subconscious, so that you simply know how to solve them when facing them in real programming.
- Quote: hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times. I got very good at it! I could do it in my sleep. I minimized the keystrokes, tuned the variable names, and tweaked the algorithm structure until it was just right. Although I didn’t know it at the time, this was my first kata.
- Quote: 60s I could wait a day or two to see the results of a compile. In the late ’70s a 50,000-line program might take 45 minutes to compile. Even in the ’90s, long build times were the norm.

## 2. Saying No
Amount of Notes: 16
- Quote: “Is good code impossible? Is professionalism impossible?”

Answer: I say no
- Quote: THE COST OF SAYING YES
- Quote: he is really asking “Is
- Quote: said one thing correctly all along: The code was a throwaway
- Quote: The client will always extend the deadline. They will always want more features.
- Quote: Good code has become impossible.
- Quote: Is good code impossible in modern software development?
- Quote: You are lying
- Quote: trying
- Comment: Trying is like defining all done bad
- Quote: Perhaps you don’t like that idea? Perhaps you think trying is a positive thing to do. After all, would Columbus have discovered America if he hadn’t tried?
- Quote: The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes
- Quote: Providing too much detail can be an invitation for micro-management.
- Quote: can
- Comment: Both fight with the same commitment
- Quote: Managers are people with a job to do, and most managers know how to do that job pretty well. Part of that job is to pursue and defend their objectives as aggressively as they can.

By the same token, programmers are also people with a job to do, and most of them know how to get that job done pretty well. If they are professionals they will pursue and defend their objectives as aggressively as they can.
- Quote: Indeed
- Comment: Thomas, said no to bugfix a data fuckup which has been a week in production
- Quote: No. Not if you are a professional.

Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no

## 13. Teams and Projects
Amount of Notes: 5
- Quote: Teams are harder to build than projects. Therefore, it is better to form persistent teams that move together from one project to the next and can take on more than one project at a time. 
- Quote: Aside from having a gelled team working on your projects, the advantage of this scheme is that in an emergency the business can say, “Project B is in crisis; put 100% of your effort on that project for the next three weeks.”

Reallocating priorities that quickly is virtually impossible with the teams that came out of the blender, but gelled teams that are working on two or three projects concurrently can turn on a dime.
- Quote: Banks and insurance companies tried to form teams around projects. This is a foolish approach
- Quote: Now here’s a rule: There is no such thing as half a person.
- Quote: banks and insurance companies over the years. One thing they seem to have in common is the odd way they partition projects.

## 5. Test Driven Development
Amount of Notes: 3
- Quote: writing your tests first, creates a force that drives you to a better decoupled design
- Quote: There have been several reports4 and studies5 that describe significant defect reduction. From IBM, to Microsoft, from Sabre to Symantec, company after company and team after team have experienced defect reductions of 2X, 5X, and even 10
- Quote: You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail—and not compiling is failing.
You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

## 8. Testing Strategies
Amount of Notes: 6
- Quote: typically not executed as part of the Continuous Integration suite, because they often have longer runtimes
- Quote: at this level that we might see performance and throughput tests.
- Quote: Integration tests are choreography tests. They do not test business rules
- Quote: The test automation pyramid
- Quote: In general, the business writes the happy-path tests, while QA writes the corner, boundary, and unhappy-path tests.
- Quote: it should be the goal of the development group that QA find nothing wrong.

## 7. Acceptance Testing
Amount of Notes: 20
- Quote: effectively eliminate communication errors between programmers and stakeholders is to write automated acceptance tests
- Quote: All too often both parties agree that they understand and leave with completely different ideas
- Quote: Every time someone commits a module, the CI system should kick off a build, and then run all the tests in the system. The results of that run should be emailed to everyone on the team.
- Quote: Keep the GUI tests to a minimum
- Quote: The trick is to design the system so that you can treat the GUI as though it were an API rather than a set of buttons, sliders, grids, and menus
- Quote: Unit tests dig into the guts of the system making calls to methods in particular classes. Acceptance tests invoke the system much farther out, at the API or sometimes even UI leve
- Quote: Acceptance tests are written by the business for the business (even when you, the developer, end up writing them).
- Quote: Acceptance tests are not unit tests. Unit tests are written by programmers for programmers
- Quote: Following the principle of “late precision,” acceptance tests should be written as late as possible, typically a few days before the feature is implemented
- Quote: done
- Quote: The cost of running the manual test plan is so enormous that they have decided to sacrifice it and simply live with the fact that they won’t know if half of their product works
- Quote: Acceptance tests should always be automated
- Quote: purpose of acceptance tests is communication, clarity, and precisio
- Quote: ambiguity of “done.” When a developer says he’s done with a task, what does that mean? Is the developer done in the sense that he’s ready to deploy the feature with full confidence? Or does he mean that he’s ready for QA? Or perhaps he’s done writing it and has gotten it to run once but hasn’t really tested it yet.
- Quote: Professional developers don’t flesh out a requirement until they are just about to develop it
- Quote: Professional developers understand that estimates can, and should, be made based on low precision requirements, and recognize that those estimates are estimates. To reinforce this, professional developers always include error bars with their estimates so that the business understands the uncertainty.
- Quote: In the end, the more precise you make your requirements, the less relevant they become as the system is implemented
- Quote: Once they see the requirement actually running, they have a better idea of what they really want—and it’s usually not what they are seeing.
- Quote: bit by bit I found myself implementing this application while he sat there and watched. Within the first twenty minutes it was clear that his emphasis had changed from learning how to do it himself to making sure that what I did was what he wanted.
- Quote: My explanation simply made no sense to him at all

## 4. Coding
Amount of Notes: 20
- Quote: and in general prove to ourselves that we have brains the size of a planet, all while not having to interact with the messy complexities of other people
- Quote: No matter how skilled you are, you will certainly benefit from another programmer’s thoughts and ideas.
- Quote: There is no way to rush. You can’t make yourself code faster. You can’t make yourself solve problems faster. If you try, you’ll just slow yourself down and make a mess that slows everyone else down, too.
- Quote: Your original estimates are more accurate than any changes you make while your boss is confronting you
- Quote: You miss elegant solutions because the creative part of your mind is suppressed by the intensity of your focus
- Quote: Likewise, a software developer who creates many bugs is acting unprofessionally.
- Quote: Test Driven Development (TDD),
- Quote: and
- Quote: I fixed the problem, of course, but never had the courage to turn off the automatic hack that inspected and fixed the counters. To this day I’m not convinced there wasn’t another hole
- Quote: from scratch in assembler
- Quote: creative output depends on creative input.
- Quote: As soon as you sit down next to someone else, the issues that were blocking you melt away
- Quote: that next time you may be the one who needs to interrupt someone else. So the professional attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful.
- Quote: Avoid the Zone. This state of consciousness is not really hyper-productive and is certainly not infallible. It’s really just a mild meditative state in which certain rational faculties are diminished in favor of a sense of speed.
- Quote: When I am worried about an argument with my wife, or a customer crisis, or a sick child, I can’t maintain focus
- Quote: I find myself with my eyes on the screen and my fingers on the keyboard, doing nothing
- Quote: working at 3 AM is what serious professionals do. How wrong I was!

That code came back to bite us over and over
- Quote: The bottom line is that the opportunity for distraction is high.
- Quote: I realized, during that long night, that typing blind is all about confidence
- Quote: Being able to sense your errors is really important

## 3. Saying Yes
Amount of Notes: 4
- Quote: Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them. However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make “yes” possible
- Quote: Years of experience have taught us that breaking disciplines only slows us down.
- Quote: Creating a language of commitment may sound a bit scary, but it can help solve many of the communication problems
- Quote: telltale signs of noncommitment:

## 1. Professionalism
Amount of Notes: 12
- Quote: Laugh
- Quote: He will not demean another for making a mistake, because he knows he may be the next to fail
- Quote: timid
- Quote: programming is an act of supreme arrogance.
- Comment: Okey, wieso auch immer das so wichtig ist
- Quote: put yourself in your employer’s shoes 
- Quote: You don’t have to be a domain expert, but there is a reasonable amount 
- Quote: Mentoring
- Comment: Wiederspruch zu lernen nebenbei
- Quote: simple exercises such as the Bowling Game or Prime Factors. I call these exercises kata. There are many such kata
- Quote: Here is a minimal list of the things that every software professional should be conversant with:
- Quote: You should plan on working 60 hours per week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading, practicing, learning, and otherwise enhancing your career.
- Comment: I strongly disagree
- Quote: you refine the design so that the next change is easier
- Quote: surprised

## A. Tooling
Amount of Notes: 15
- Quote: My current toolkit is a simple subset of that menagerie. I use git for source code control, Tracker for issue management, Jenkins for Continuous Build, IntelliJ as my IDE, XUnit for testing, and FITNESSE for component testing.

My machine is a Macbook Pro, 2.8Ghz Intel Core i7, with a 17-inch matte screen, 8GB ram, 512GB SSD, with two extra screens.
- Comment: Zuper vo ihm
- Quote: That’s what I mean by detail. Try coding the horrible logic for sorting out line ends in UML!
- Quote: When was the last time you had to deal with text files that use the “wrong” convention?
- Comment: We did with seproject
- Quote: If you returned the carriage and did not send a line-feed character (\n = 0 × 0A), then the new line would print on top of the old line.
- Comment: Er erklärt schreibmaschienen
- Quote: Programmers are detail managers. That’s what we do. We specify the behavior of systems in the minutest detail
- Quote: Boy was I wrong. Not only hasn’t this dream been fulfilled, but every attempt to move in that direction has met with abject failure. Not that there aren’t tools and systems out there that demonstrate the potential; it’s just that those tools simply don’t truly realize the dream, and hardly anybody seems to want to use them
- Comment: Actually no, this is what might be possible again with ai tools
- Quote: we don’t want to drive very many tests through the UI because UIs are notoriously volatile
- Quote: Component testing tools can also be used for many integration tests, but are less than appropriate for tests that are driven through the UI.
- Comment: Also das sind integr tests
- Quote: Component testing tools can also be used for many integration tests, but are less than appropriate for tests that are driven through the UI.
- Quote: Component testing tools can also be used for many integration tests, but are less than appropriate for tests that are driven through the UI.
- Quote: Dependent tests are a deep trap that you don’t want to fall into.
- Quote: I’ve also simply used a wiki. Wikis are fine for internal projects. They allow you to set up any scheme you like
- Quote: Sometimes the best issue-tracking system of all is a set of cards and a bulletin board. The bulletin board is divided into columns such as “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”
- Quote: Every developer keeps his or her own copy of the entire history of the project on their local machine
- Comment: Speziell, macht man das noch so? 
- Quote: we never check in code that doesn’t pass all the tests. Never ever.

## 9. Time Management
Amount of Notes: 23
- Quote: They keep their options open by keeping an open mind about alternate solutions. They never become so vested in a solution that they can’t abandon it.
- Quote: the inflection point! You can still go back and fix the design. But you can also continue to go forward
- Quote: eventually you will make a decision that leads to a mess.
- Quote: Professionals avoid getting so vested in an idea that they can’t abandon it and turn around. They keep an open mind about other ideas so that when they hit a dead end they still have other options.
- Quote: defense to protect us from the judgment of others.
- Quote: preparing for the lie we’ll tell when someone asks us what we are doing and why we are doing it
- Quote: priority inversion. You raise the priority of a task so that you can postpone the task that has the true priority.
- Quote: 25-minute window of productive time that you aggressively defend against all interruptions.
- Quote: Some people get so comfortable with the technique that they estimate their tasks in tomatoes and then measure their weekly tomato velocity
- Quote: On a good day you might get 12 or even 14 tomatoes done
- Quote: your time is divided into tomato and non-tomato time
- Quote: While I ride I listen to podcasts about astronomy or politics. Sometimes I just listen to my favorite music. And sometimes I just turn the headphones off and listen to nature.
- Comment: Consious about listening to music
- Quote: muscle focus helps to recharge mental focu
- Quote: you can’t force the focus
- Quote: Seven hours of sleep will often give me a full eight hours’ worth of focus-manna.
- Quote: Caffeine also puts a strange “jitter” on your focus. 
- Quote: Professional developers learn to manage their time to take advantage of their focus-manna.
- Quote: Any argument that can’t be settled in five minutes can’t be settled by arguing.” The reason it goes on so long is that there is no clear evidence supporting either side. The argument is probably religious, as opposed to factual.
- Quote: Iteration Planning Meetings
- Quote: When the meeting gets boring, leave.
- Quote: You need to use your time wisely. So be very carefu
- Quote: Some in attendance may find them invaluable; others may find them redundant or useless.
- Quote: There are two truths about meeting.

Meetings are necessary.
Meetings are huge time wasters.
